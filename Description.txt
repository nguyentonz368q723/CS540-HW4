Description
---***---

(1) Objective:
- This programming assignment focuses on implementing and
comparing three page replacement algorithms (LRU, Optimal, FIFO)
in a demand-paging scenario. The goal is to simulate
these algorithms using a given page reference string and
analyze their performance based on the number of page faults incurred.

(2) Key Requirements:

- Implement Algorithms: Develop LRU, Optimal,
and FIFO page replacement algorithms.

- Input Handling: Create a mechanism to input
a page reference string and specify the number
of memory frames.

- Simulation: Simulate each algorithm's behavior
 on the provided page reference string
 and calculate page faults incurred during simulation.

- Output Format: Display clear, structured output
for each algorithm, showing page faults at each step
and the total number of page faults.
