Instructions
---***---
(1) Install C++ Compiler (if not already installed):

- Make sure you have a C++ development environment installed on
your computer before executing this application. Examples of
such environments include g++ for Linux and Visual Studio for
Windows. If not, install the appropriate C++ compiler by downloading it.

(2) Copy the Source Code:

The program's whole C++ source code should be copied into a new text
document on your PC. Save the file as NguyenTon-HW4.cpp,
for instance, then rename it with the.cpp extension.

(3) Compile the Source Code:

- Launch the command prompt on Windows or a terminal on Linux.
- Use the command cd path_to_directory to go to the directory holding the C++ source file.
For example: C:\Users\tonyk\Desktop\New folder\C++\CS540\HW4>
- Compile the source code using the following command: g++ *.cpp -o NguyenTon-HW4

(4) Run the Program:

- After successful compilation, run the program by entering the
following command in the terminal or command prompt: NguyenTon-HW4.exe
- To launch the application on Windows using Visual Studio,
open the executable file within the Visual Studio environment.

(5) View the Results:

- Based on the supplied input settings found in the source code,
the program will calculate and show the total number of page faults
for each page replacement method (LRU, Optimal, FIFO) once it has been run.
*** Because I use the sample input that the question required so it
still prints the output only. 
*** If you would like to change another input and see what the faults are,
you could change this "1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5" in the line 140.
